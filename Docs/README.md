# How we help the needy?
The [CISCE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_the_Indian_School_Certificate_Examinations) board computer science students require to 
make projects where they code about 20 complex programs in Java. 
Then they are required to document the code using:
- Variable description charts
- Different I/O
- Algorithm

<em>"A programming language is for thinking about programs, 
not for expressing programs you've already thought of. 
It should be a pencil, not a pen."<br>&ensp;&#8211;Paul Graham</em>

### Hence we decided to automate: 
- The ugliest part of the documentation process, i.e. rewriting your code as an algorithm

### Note
We will continue updating the format to make the algorithm look 
more human-made. If the board changes the style of algorithm, we'll 
change ours to theirs.
