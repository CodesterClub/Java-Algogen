# How we help the needy?
The [CISCE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_the_Indian_School_Certificate_Examinations) board computer science students require to 
make projects where they code about 20 complex programs in Java. 
Then they are required to document the code using:
- Variable description charts
- Different I/O
- Algorithm

<em>"A programming language is for thinking about programs, 
not for expressing programs you've already thought of. 
It should be a pencil, not a pen."<br>&ensp;&#8211;Paul Graham</em>

### Hence we decided to automate the ugliest part of 
the documentation process:
- Rewriting your code as an algorithm

### If the board takes action to prevent students using our 
software, we'll change the format of algorithms or if required 
the language from Java to what is in the board's syllabus as 
and when required.
