# Java-Algogen (Java algorithm generator)
A project to 'help' the 'needy' to convert their Java code into an algorithm document. 
The software only supports one kind of algorithm format yet. 
Plans to add more formats is not under consideration yet ( that is all the yets you'll see ).

## How to use?
- You need to [download the ZIP](https://github.com/OogleGlu/Java-Algogen/archive/main.zip). 
- Then extract it somewhere.
- Place folder containing your java source files in the `root` of the extracted directory.
- Execute the class `Main`. 
- Enter the source file path and the output will be generated as a `Class_Algo.txt` in the `Algos` directory of `root`.

## How will we 'help' the needy?
The [CISCE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_the_Indian_School_Certificate_Examinations) board computer science students require to 
make projects where they code about 20 complex programs in Java. 
Then they are required to document the code using:
- Variable description charts
- Different I/O
- Algorithm

## Remember
<em>"A programming language is for thinking about programs, 
not for expressing programs you've already thought of. 
It should be a pencil, not a pen."<br>

## Who are the 'needy'?
As of 12th Jan of 2021, I ([OogleGlu](https://github.com/OogleGlu)) have just recovered from writing about 20 algorithms 
for my [ISC-Computer-Practical](https://github.com/OogleGlu/ISC-Computer-Practical) in a single night for submission to school. 
Why? Coz I am lazy enough to not do a day's work in that day. This project is intended to save such lazy people.<br>

## Hence,
We decided to automate the ugliest part of the documentation process, 
i.e. rewriting 20 codes as an algorithm.

## Note
We will continue updating the format to make the algorithm look 
more human-made. If the board changes the style of algorithm, we'll 
change ours to fit theirs.
