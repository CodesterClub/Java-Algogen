# Java-Algogen (Java algorithm generator)
A project to <i>help</i> the <i>needy</i> to convert their Java code into an algorithm document. 
The software only supports one kind of algorithm format as of yet. 
Plans to add more formats is not under consideration yet ( that is all the yets you'll see ).

## How to use
As of now you need to Download the ZIP. Then you 
need to execute the class Main in it. You'll enter 
the java code in the terminal and the output will be generated 
as a 'YourClass_Algo.txt' file which is saved in the 'Algos' directory.

## How will we help the needy?
The [CISCE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_the_Indian_School_Certificate_Examinations) board computer science students require to 
make projects where they code about 20 complex programs in Java. 
Then they are required to document the code using:
- Variable description charts
- Different I/O
- Algorithm

## Who are the needy:
As of 12th Jan of 2021, I've ([OogleGlu](OogleGlu)) just recovered from writing about 20 algorithms 
for my [ISC-Computer-Project](OogleGlu/ISC-Computer-Project) repository (the .algo files). Why? Coz I am lazy 
enough to not do a day's work in that day.
This project is intended to save such lazy people.

## Remember:
<em>"A programming language is for thinking about programs, 
not for expressing programs you've already thought of. 
It should be a pencil, not a pen."<br>&ensp;&#8211;Paul Graham</em>

## Hence: 
We decided to automate the ugliest part of the documentation process, 
i.e. rewriting 20 codes as an algorithm.

## Note
We will continue updating the format to make the algorithm look 
more human-made. If the board changes the style of algorithm, we'll 
change ours to fit theirs.
