# Java-Algogen
A project to 'help' the needy to convert their Java code into an algorithm document. 
The software only supports one kind of algorithm format as of yet. 
Plans to add more formats is not under consideration yet ( that is all the yets you'll see ).

## If you wish to contribute

## How to use
As of now you need to Download the ZIP. Then you 
need to execute the class Main in it. You'll enter 
the java code in the terminal and the output will be generated 
as a 'YourClass_Algo.txt' file which is saved in the 'Algos' directory.
